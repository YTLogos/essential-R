These slides are a rough guideline of how to write `R` code using common
software, such as `devtools`, `testthat`, `lintr`, `covr`, `data.table`, `Rcpp` and its derivates, and other frequently used tools to program in `R`. We don't claim at any point that the material treated here covers all of R, but rather serve as a the author's list of essential `R` tools he frequently uses.

These slides are no introduction on how to program functionally, procedurally or in an object-oriented way, how to write code in general, or how to speed it up. The interested reader is referred to:

- Robert Martin: Clean Code,
- Andrew Hunt: The Pragmatic Programmer,
- Gang of Four: Design Patterns,
- Hadley Wickham: R packages,
- Hadley Wickham: Advanced R,
- Dirk Eddelbuettel: Seamless R and C++ Integration with Rcpp,
- Thomas Cormen: Introduction to Algorithms,
- Dan Gusfield: Algorithms on Strings, Trees and Sequences,
- Donald Knuth: The Art of Computer Programming,

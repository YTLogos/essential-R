# Data analysis and statistical modeling

The following few sections introduce packages I frequently use for data analysis, modelling and machine learning.

## Stan

### BRMS

### Rstanarm

## greta

## MCMC

-  mcmctools, mcmcvis, mcmc, mcmcpack

## mlR and openML

CRAN offers dozens of packages related to machine and statistical learning, many of which doing the same. `mlR` wraps many of these into one big library.
`mlR` integrates with `openML`, an open machine learning platform where people share code, data and algorithms. Here we show an example where we use a Gaussian process to predict the Kyphosis label from the `gam` package.

```{r}
  library(mlr)
  task  <- mlr::makeClassifTask(data = kyphosis, target = "Kyphosis")
  lrn   <- mlr::makeLearner("classif.gausspr")

  n <- nrow(kyphosis)
  train.set <- sample(n, size = 2/3*n)
  test.set  <- setdiff(1:n, train.set)

  model <- mlr::train(lrn, task, subset = train.set)
  pred  <- stats::predict(model, task = task, subset = test.set)
  performance(pred, measures = list(mmce, acc))
```

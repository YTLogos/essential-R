<p>These slides are a rough guideline of how to write <code>R</code> code using common software, such as <code>devtools</code>, <code>testthat</code>, <code>lintr</code>, <code>covr</code>, <code>data.table</code>, <code>Rcpp</code> and its derivates, and other frequently used tools to program in <code>R</code>. We don’t claim at any point that the material treated here covers all of R, but rather serve as a the author’s list of essential <code>R</code> tools he frequently uses.</p>
<p>These slides are no introduction on how to program functionally, procedurally or in an object-oriented way, how to write code in general, or how to speed it up. The interested reader is referred to:</p>

<div id="writing-r-packages" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Writing R packages</h2>
<p>When creating an R package <code>devtools</code> and <code>covr</code> covers almost any functionality required. The following functions delineate how my typical workflow looks:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>devtools::create(&quot;newpkg&quot;)
devtools::test()
devtools::document()
devtools::check_cran()
devtools::lint()
devtools::run_examples()
covr::package_coverage()
devtools::install()
devtools::use_rcpp()</code></pre>
<p>This basically covers your complete development life cycle (except code coverage). <code>devtools</code> is <strong>tremendously</strong> useful. If you look for sth that helps you write packages, <code>devtools</code> has a function for it. For all other things, use <code>usethis</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>usethis::use_namespace()
usethis::use_code_of_conduct()
usethis::use_travis()
usethis::use_vignette()
usethis::use_gpl3_license()</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="testing-code" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Testing code</h2>
<p>Right after creating your package, you should write your first test (yes, really). Testing is <strong>essential</strong> for writing good software. The same way as programming languages change your way of thinking, do unit tests change your way of writing functions. <code>testthat</code> is probably the best way to go here. Tests are usually put in <code>tests/testthat</code>. You can use:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>devtools::use_testthat()</code></pre>
<p>to create a test suite automatically. A test would look like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>testthat::test_that(&quot;i know my math&quot;, {
    testthat::expect_equal(g(), 2)
})

testthat::test_that(&quot;i know my math&quot;, {
    testthat::expect_false(&quot;wrong&quot; == &quot;right&quot;)
})</code></pre>
<p>Let’s test this.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>devtools::test(&quot;./newpkg&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>✔ | OK F W S | Context

⠏ |  0       | hello
⠋ |  1       | hello
⠙ |  2       | hello
✔ |  2       | hello

══ Results ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
OK:       2
Failed:   0
Warnings: 0
Skipped:  0</code></pre>
<p>A function ideally does <em>one task and one task only</em>. Functions with side effects, multiple operations or exceedingly large method body easily introduce bugs. Keep your functions concise! This also simplifies testing, because it is easier to track down a bug in a shorter function.</p>
</div>
<div id="documenting-code" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Documenting code</h2>
<p>Having written the first unit test, we can create the actual function for it <strong>and</strong> its documentation using <code>roxygen2</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#&#39; @title Adds 1 and 1
#&#39;
#&#39; @description This magnificent function computes the sum of 1 and 1.
#&#39;
#&#39; @export  
#&#39;
#&#39; @return  returns 2
#&#39;  
#&#39; @examples
#&#39;   a &lt;- g()
#&#39;   print(a)
g &lt;- function() 1 + 1</code></pre>
<p>Then build the documentation:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>devtools::document(&quot;./newpkg&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>An excellent help for creating documentation (of S3 and S4) is for instance <a href="https://github.com/variani/pckdev">pckdev</a> or the official <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html">vignette</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="checking-code" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Checking code</h2>
<p>If you want to submit your package to <code>CRAN</code> or <code>Bioconductor</code> certain criteria must be fulfilled. Some of which can be tested by checking or package like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>devtools::check_cran(&quot;./newpkg&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>Checking 1 CRAN packages =================================================</code></pre>
<pre><code>Results saved in /var/folders/cx/v45t2v2n6b548_vfn76vnzlw0050sr/T//RtmpBLPQQw/check_cran708617306e3c</code></pre>
<pre><code>Package library: /private/var/folders/cx/v45t2v2n6b548_vfn76vnzlw0050sr/T/RtmpBLPQQw/R-lib, /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.4/Resources/library</code></pre>
<pre><code>Installing dependencies --------------------------------------------------</code></pre>
<pre><code>Installing 1 packages: ./newpkg</code></pre>
<pre><code>Skipping 1 packages without source:./newpkg</code></pre>
<pre><code>Checking packages --------------------------------------------------------</code></pre>
<pre><code>Checking 0 packages: </code></pre>
<pre><code>Package library: /private/var/folders/cx/v45t2v2n6b548_vfn76vnzlw0050sr/T/RtmpBLPQQw/R-lib, /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.4/Resources/library</code></pre>
<pre><code>NULL</code></pre>
<p>This does not test for Bioconductor though. For this you have to install <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BiocCheck.html"> BioCheck</a> manually and call <code>R CMD BiocCheck newpkg*.tar</code> on the command line.</p>
</div>
<div id="static-code-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> Static code analysis</h2>
<p><code>lintr</code> checks your code for style, syntax error and possible issues. You can also incorporate <code>lintr</code> in your unit tests and let them fail, if lints are discovered.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>if (requireNamespace(&quot;lintr&quot;, quietly = TRUE)) {
    test_that(&quot;this is lint free&quot;, {
        lintr::expect_lint_free()
    })
}</code></pre>
<p>What <code>lintr</code> considers worth reporting can be customized in a <code>.lintr</code> file in your package root directory.</p>
<p>Let’s see if our small package is lint free:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>devtools::lint(&quot;./newpkg&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>Linting newpkg....</code></pre>
<pre><code>R/bad_bad_file.R:3:1: style: lines should not be more than 80 characters.
                                                                              myRet = a+b

                                                                              ^~~~~

<p>Whoops!</p>
</div>
<div id="running-examples" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.7</span> Running examples</h2>
<p>Examples are extremely helpful both for the user and debugging purposes. When we documented our function <code>g</code> we already have an example how to use the function. We can manually call all examples using:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>devtools::run_examples(&quot;./newpkg&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>Updating newpkg documentation</code></pre>
<pre><code>Loading newpkg</code></pre>
<pre><code>Running 1 example files in newpkg ----------------------------------------</code></pre>
<pre><code>Loading newpkg</code></pre>
<pre><code>Running examples in g.Rd -------------------------------------------------</code></pre>
<pre><code>&gt; 
&gt;   a &lt;- g()
&gt;   print(a)
[1] 2</code></pre>
<pre><code>Loading newpkg</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="code-coverage" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.8</span> Code coverage</h2>
<p><code>covr</code> lets you check how much of your code is used and tested. If you created a package just run:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>covr::package_coverage(&quot;./newpkg&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>newpkg Coverage: 50.00%</code></pre>
<pre><code>R/bad_bad_file.R: 0.00%</code></pre>
<pre><code>R/newpkg.R: 100.00%</code></pre>
<p>Having high code coverage usually correlates with a good testing suite. The more functionality is tested, the larger the code coverage.</p>
</div>
<div id="profiling-and-benchmarking" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.9</span> Profiling and benchmarking</h2>
<p>If you think your code runs slowly, you can try to find the bottleneck, for instance, using <code>profvis</code> and <code>microbenchmark</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&quot;ggplot2&quot;)
profvis::profvis({
    g &lt;- ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) + geom_point(size = 1, alpha = 0.2)

<p>At this point you are finished writing your package and you want to provide it to a large user base. A nice landing page often helps gaining popularity. The easiest way to do so is using <code>pkgdown</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pkgdown::build_site(pkg = &quot;./newpkg&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>This creates a web-page like this:</p>

<p>Much of <code>R</code>’s popularity is due to its fantastic ecosystem. <code>R</code> users benefit heavily from CRAN and Bioconductor packages created by its community.</p>
<p>For data analysis or statistics <code>R</code> is a good choice for various reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>high-level,</li>
<li>easy to install packages,</li>
<li>can be extended to <code>C++</code> without needing knowledge of linking or <code>C++</code> build-systems,</li>
<li>probably the best plotting facility with <code>ggplot</code>, <code>cowplot</code>, <code>hrbrthemes</code> or <code>ggsci</code>,</li>
<li>Bioconductor, machine learning and statistics libraries,</li>
<li>small standard library.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few things, however, <code>R</code> is not so great at:</p>
<ul>
<li>in general slow,</li>
<li>not really suited for large projects,</li>
<li>poor object orientation,</li>
<li>inconsistent function names,</li>
<li>superior IDEs for Java, Python, …,</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Extending to C++ using <code>Rcpp</code></h2>
<p>Using <code>Rcpp</code> (and <code>RcppEigen</code>, <code>RcppArmadillo</code>, <code>Boost</code>) you can easily your extend your code to C++. It not only nicely wraps the standard C API, but also let’s you use standard matrix libraries such as Eigen and Armadillo or Boost :heart_eyes:.</p>
<p>If you have a project that’s not a package you can for instance create a function like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Rcpp::cppFunction(&quot;double sum(std::vector&lt;double&gt;&amp; vec) {
      double sum = .0;
      for (std::vector&lt;double&gt;::size_type i = 0; i &lt; vec.size(); ++i)
          sum += vec[i];
      return sum;
  }&quot;)

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Rcpp in a package</h3>
<p>Usually, you would want to put your source code into a <code>cpp</code> file in the <code>src</code> folder. Then you can call C++ from an R function, for instance as described below.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Define a C++ source file and put it in <code>src</code>, like this:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>#include <Rcpp.h>

// [[Rcpp::export]]
Rcpp::List dostuff()
{
  // some computations

  return Rcpp::List::create(
    Rcpp::Named("a") = ...
  );
}</code></pre>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Add this to your <code>DESCRIPTION</code>:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>Imports: Rcpp
LinkingTo: Rcpp</code></pre>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Add a comment <code>#' @useDynLib newpkg, .registration = TRUE</code> to the documentation of any function, better yet to the package doc.</p></li>
<li><p>Call <code>devtools::document()</code></p></li>
<li><p>Call <code>Rcpp::compileAttributes(&quot;./newpkg&quot;)</code></p></li>
</ol>
<p>This should let you access the C++ function from your package. For more details check out the main <a href="http://www.rcpp.org/">documentation</a> or some of my packages, like <a href="https://github.com/dirmeier/netReg">netReg</a> or <a href="https://github.com/dirmeier/datastructures">datastructures</a>. The latter also has an example how to use modules and Boost.</p>
</div>
<div id="writing-c" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> Writing <code>C++</code></h3>
<p>Here are some tools that help you develop your code&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li><code>gdb</code> and <code>lldb</code> for debugging,</li>
<li><code>valgrind</code> and <code>gprof</code> to check for memory leaks and for profiling,</li>
<li>Intel’s <code>Parallel Studio XE</code> (&lt;3) which is a toolbox for vectorization, debugging, memory checks, etc. If you can get hold of it, get it. It is magnificent.</li>
<li><code>BOOST</code> for unit tests, data structures and basically everything you ever need,</li>
<li><code>cppcheck</code> for static code analysis,</li>
<li><code>doxygen</code> for code documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many C++ libraries, like <code>Dlib</code>, <code>Eigen</code> or <code>tensorflow</code> have an R interface, so before implementing functionality yourself check out if there is already an implementation for it.</p>
<p>At this point it also makes sense to have a look at various <code>C++</code> books such as</p>
<ul>
<li>Scott Meyers: Effective Modern C++,</li>
<li>Scott Meyers: Effective C++,</li>
<li>Ben Klemens: 21. century C,</li>
<li>Kurt Guntheroth: Optimized C++,</li>
<li>Nicolai Josuttis: C++17 - the complete guide,</li>
<li>David Vandevoorde: C++ Templates - the compete guide.</li>
</ul>
<p>For fast numerical code OpenMP and advanced vector and streaming SIMD extensions (AVX/SSE) is often the way to go. Writing good code using AVX is however not very simple and knowledge of memory alignment is required. However, starting from version 4 (?), OpenMP easily allows vectorization using <code>#pragma simd</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note: the last lines in this section are heavily subjective and only state the author’s opinion.</strong></p>
<p>More and more garbage code is forced onto the scientific community, mostly related to academic hubris and lack of knowledge about how to <em>program</em> (we don’t mean how to <em>accomplish a task using a programming language</em>, but to embrace a language and its philosophy at its very core). If you aim to publish your code, make sure it follows <em>contemporary</em> good practices, standards and guidelines and that it is consistent, for instance by following people’s code who are part of the community for ages. At this point we want to emphasize that the author doesn’t claim to know C++, but rather that he is annoyed by this very trend.</p>
<p>C++ is a large, complex language. Chances that you mess up, introduce bugs and memory leaks are high, unless you have some experience. In academia in mostly results in bad, un-maintainable code. If your argument is <em>but it is faster than R</em>, at least have a look at <code>Julia</code> or <code>Python</code> (and <code>numpy</code>). If you still prefer hacking in C++ try to stick to some guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>don’t include C headers in your C++ projects .. just don’t. C and C++ are <strong>two</strong> languages. There is for need for <code>FILE*</code> or <code>malloc</code>.</li>
<li>modern C++ rarely needs pointers. Use <code>std::vector</code> or <code>std::unique_ptr</code>. No need to manually release pointers is an advantage of itself.</li>
<li>BOOST has (probably) everything you will ever need. Don’t reinvent the wheel and learn to include libraries in your project.</li>
<li>Learn how to use Cmake, Meson or autotools. You should <strong>never</strong> need to directly invoke a compiler or write a hard-coded Makefile.</li>
<li>Only because you have a PhD or M. Sc. in CS does not make you a prolific programmer. It requires staying up to date, <strong>reading other people’s code</strong> and embracing of new ideas and the very philosophy of the language and its community.</li>
<li>Print warnings. They are usually there for a reason.</li>
<li>Start a toy project or contribute to OSS projects.</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.2</span> Other packages to consider</h3>
<p>Other useful packages for plotting, using colors, animations or working with images are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>magick</code></li>
<li><code>imager</code></li>
<li><code>scales</code></li>

<div id="data.table" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> data.table</h2>
<p><code>data.table</code> is a fast implementation of R’s classical <code>data.frame</code>. I hardly ever use data frame any more, and if so only, because it seems to work nicer with <code>dplyr</code> and <code>tidyr</code>. However, using <code>dtplyr</code> this isn’t much of a problem, really.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&quot;data.table&quot;)
library(&quot;dplyr&quot;)
library(&quot;dtplyr&quot;)
library(&quot;grid&quot;)
library(&quot;gridExtra&quot;)
n &lt;- 1000
rn &lt;- rnorm(n)
ltrs &lt;- sample(letters[1:5], n, replace = TRUE)
dt &lt;- data.table(X = rn, Y = ltrs)
df &lt;- data.frame(X = rn, Y = ltrs)

dt[, .SD[sample(.N, 1)], by = c(&quot;Y&quot;)] %&gt;% tableGrob(rows = NULL) %&gt;% grid.arrange</code></pre>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-32-1.png" width="192" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>In the end it depends what style you prefer. I usually go with <code>data.table</code> alone without needing the <code>dplyr/dtplyr</code> dependency. However, the latter is usually more readable. For large data, the fastest solution is probably preferable.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dt.only &lt;- function() dt[, .SD[sample(.N, 1)], by = c(&quot;Y&quot;)]
dt.dtplyr &lt;- function() dt %&gt;% group_by(Y) %&gt;% sample_n(1)
df.dplyr &lt;- function() df %&gt;% group_by(Y) %&gt;% sample_n(1)

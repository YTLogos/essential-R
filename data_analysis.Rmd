title: "Data analysis"

Much of R's popularity is due to its fantastic ecosystem. R users benefit heavily from CRAN and Bioconductor packages created by its community. For data analysis or statistics R is a good choice for various reasons:

- high-level,
- easy to install packages,
- can be extended to C++ without needing knowledge of linking or C++ build-systems,
- probably the best plotting facility with ggplot, cowplot, hrbrthemes or ggsci,
- Bioconductor, machine learning and statistics libraries,
- small standard library.

There are a few things, however, R is not so great at:

- in general slow,
- not really suited for large projects,
- poor object orientation,
- inconsistent function names,
- superior IDEs for Java, Python, ...,
- very limited threading capabilities.

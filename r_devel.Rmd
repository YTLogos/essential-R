# R development

The following section covers tools that help and speed up developing R:

- `yeoman`
- `devtools`
- `testthat`
- `roxygen2`
- `covr`
- `lintr`
- `usethis`

## Creating R packages

If you have `yeoman` installed, you can use the `R-bones` generator in order to initialize a complete project. This gives you the following barebone:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
  yo r-bones
  ls -la newpkg
```
```{bash, include=TRUE, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
  ls -la newpkg
```


## Writing R packages

When creating an R package `devtools` and `covr` covers almost any functionality required. The following functions delineate how my typical workflow looks:

```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
  devtools::create("newpkg")
  devtools::test()
  devtools::document()
  devtools::check_cran()
  devtools::lint()
  devtools::run_examples()
  covr::package_coverage()
  devtools::install()
  devtools::use_rcpp()  
```

This basically covers your complete development life cycle (except code coverage). `devtools` is **tremendously** useful. If you look for sth that helps you write packages, `devtools` has a function for it. For all other things, use `usethis`.

```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
  usethis::use_namespace()
  usethis::use_code_of_conduct()
  usethis::use_travis()
  usethis::use_vignette()
  usethis::use_gpl3_license()
```


## Testing code

Right after creating your package, you should write your first test (yes, really). Testing is **essential** for writing good software. The same way as programming languages change your way of thinking, do unit tests change your way of writing functions. `testthat` is probably the best way to go here. Tests are usually put in `tests/testthat`.
You can use:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
  devtools::use_testthat()
```

to create a test suite automatically. A test would look like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
  testthat::test_that("i know my math", {
    testthat::expect_equal(g(), 2)
  })

  testthat::test_that("i know my math", {
      testthat::expect_false("wrong" == "right")
  })
```

Let's test this.

```{r}
  devtools::test("./newpkg")
```

A function ideally does *one task and one task only*. Functions with side effects, multiple operations or exceedingly large method body easily introduce bugs. Keep your functions concise! This also simplifies testing, because it is easier to track down a bug in a shorter function.


## Documenting code

Having written the first unit test, we can create the actual function for it **and** its documentation using `roxygen2`:

```{r}
  #' @title Adds 1 and 1
  #'
  #' @description This magnificent function computes the sum of 1 and 1.
  #'
  #' @export  
  #'
  #' @return  returns 2
  #'  
  #' @examples
  #'   a <- g()
  #'   print(a)
  g <- function() 1 + 1
```

Then build the documentation:

```{r}
  devtools::document("./newpkg")
```

An excellent help for creating documentation (of S3 and S4) is for instance <a href="https://github.com/variani/pckdev">pckdev</a> or the official <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html">vignette</a>.


## Checking code

If you want to submit your package to `CRAN` or `Bioconductor` certain criteria must be fulfilled. Some of which can be tested by checking or package like this:

```{r,  eval=TRUE, message=TRUE,  include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
  devtools::check_cran("./newpkg")
```

This does not test for Bioconductor though. For this you have to install <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BiocCheck.html"> BioCheck</a> manually and call `R CMD BiocCheck newpkg*.tar` on the command line.


## Static code analysis

`lintr` checks your code for style, syntax error and possible issues. You can also incorporate `lintr` in your unit tests and let them fail, if lints are discovered.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (requireNamespace("lintr", quietly = TRUE)) {
  test_that("this is lint free", {  
    lintr::expect_lint_free()
  })
}
```

What `lintr` considers worth reporting can be customized in a `.lintr` file in your package root directory.

Let's see if our small package is lint free:

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=TRUE,  include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
  devtools::lint("./newpkg")
```

Whoops!


## Running examples

Examples are extremely helpful both for the user and debugging purposes. When
we documented our function `g` we already have an example how to use the function. We can manually call all examples using:

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
  devtools::run_examples("./newpkg")
```


## Code coverage

`covr` lets you check how much of your code is used and tested. If you created a package just run:

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
  covr::package_coverage("./newpkg")
```

Having high code coverage usually correlates with a good testing suite. The more functionality is tested, the larger the code coverage.

## Profiling and benchmarking

If you think your code runs slowly, you can try to find the bottleneck, for instance, using `profvis` and `microbenchmark`.

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.width=4}
  library('profvis')
  library('gam')
  data(kyphosis)
  profvis::profvis({
    sp <- stats::spline(kyphosis$Age, kyphosis$Number, method="n")
    gm <- gam::gam(Number ~ Age, family=poisson, data=kyphosis)

    df <- data.frame(
      X = c(sp$x, kyphosis$Age),
      Y = c(sp$y, predict(gm, kyphosis)),
      model = c(rep("Spline", length(sp$x)),
                rep("GAM",    length(kyphosis$Age))))

    g <- ggplot(df) +
      geom_point(aes(x=X, y=Y, color=model)) +
      theme_void()

    print(g)
  })
```

Often it however suffices to just benchmark two methods against each other.

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
  f <- function(n) {
    sum <- 0
    for (i in seq(n)) sum <- sum + i
  }
  g <- function(.) sum(.)

  microbenchmark::microbenchmark(f(10000), g(10000))
```


## Creating a landing page

At this point you are finished writing your package and you want to provide it to a large user base. A nice landing page often helps gaining popularity. The easiest way to do so is using `pkgdown`.

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
  pkgdown::build_site(pkg= "./newpkg")
```

This creates a web-page like this:

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://rawgit.com/dirmeier/essential-R/master/fig/pkgdown.jpg" alt="oh no" width="500px">
</div>

A good example can be found <a href="https://dirmeier.github.io/netReg/">here</a>.

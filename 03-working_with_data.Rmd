# Data wrangling

Every analysis of data starts with preprocessing and parsing. For this I've found `dplyr` and `tidyr` tremendously useful. There are many more great tools in the tidyverse and Rstudio, such as `purrr` (explained later), `magrittr` or `tibble`, but these two simlify most of my work.

```{r}
  library(dplyr)
  data(iris)
  group_by(iris, Species) %>%
    summarize(Petal.Length = mean(Petal.Length),
              Sepal.Length = mean(Sepal.Length)) %>%
    mutate(Species = toupper(Species))

  tidyr::gather(iris, Col, Val, -Species) %>% head
```

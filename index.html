<p>These slides are a rough guideline of how to write <code>R</code> code using common software, such as <code>devtools</code>, <code>testthat</code>, <code>lintr</code>, <code>covr</code>, <code>data.table</code>, <code>Rcpp</code> and its derivates, and other frequently used tools to program in <code>R</code>. We don’t claim at any point that the material treated here covers all of R, but rather serve as a the author’s list of essential <code>R</code> tools he frequently uses.</p>
<p>These slides are no introduction on how to program functionally, procedurally or in an object-oriented way, how to write code in general, or how to speed it up. The interested reader is referred to:</p>

<div id="writing-r-packages" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Writing R packages</h2>
<p>When creating an R package <code>devtools</code> and <code>covr</code> covers almost any functionality required. The following functions delineate how my typical workflow looks:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">devtools::<span class="kw">create</span>(<span class="st">&quot;newpkg&quot;</span>)
devtools::<span class="kw">test</span>()
devtools::<span class="kw">document</span>()
devtools::<span class="kw">check_cran</span>()
devtools::<span class="kw">lint</span>()
devtools::<span class="kw">run_examples</span>()
covr::<span class="kw">package_coverage</span>()
devtools::<span class="kw">install</span>()
devtools::<span class="kw">use_rcpp</span>()</code></pre></div>
<p>This basically covers your complete development life cycle (except code coverage). <code>devtools</code> is <strong>tremendously</strong> useful. If you look for sth that helps you write packages, <code>devtools</code> has a function for it. For all other things, use <code>usethis</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">usethis::<span class="kw">use_namespace</span>()
usethis::<span class="kw">use_code_of_conduct</span>()
usethis::<span class="kw">use_travis</span>()
usethis::<span class="kw">use_vignette</span>()
usethis::<span class="kw">use_gpl3_license</span>()</code></pre></div>
</div>
<div id="testing-code" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Testing code</h2>
<p>Right after creating your package, you should write your first test (yes, really). Testing is <strong>essential</strong> for writing good software. The same way as programming languages change your way of thinking, do unit tests change your way of writing functions. <code>testthat</code> is probably the best way to go here. Tests are usually put in <code>tests/testthat</code>. You can use:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">devtools::<span class="kw">use_testthat</span>()</code></pre></div>
<p>to create a test suite automatically. A test would look like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">testthat::<span class="kw">test_that</span>(<span class="st">&quot;i know my math&quot;</span>, {
    testthat::<span class="kw">expect_equal</span>(<span class="kw">g</span>(), <span class="dv">2</span>)
})

testthat::<span class="kw">test_that</span>(<span class="st">&quot;i know my math&quot;</span>, {
    testthat::<span class="kw">expect_false</span>(<span class="st">&quot;wrong&quot;</span> ==<span class="st"> &quot;right&quot;</span>)
})</code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s test this.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">devtools::<span class="kw">test</span>(<span class="st">&quot;./newpkg&quot;</span>)</code></pre></div>
<pre><code>✔ | OK F W S | Context

⠏ |  0       | hello
⠋ |  1       | hello
⠙ |  2       | hello
✔ |  2       | hello

══ Results ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
OK:       2
Failed:   0
Warnings: 0
Skipped:  0</code></pre>
<p>A function ideally does <em>one task and one task only</em>. Functions with side effects, multiple operations or exceedingly large method body easily introduce bugs. Keep your functions concise! This also simplifies testing, because it is easier to track down a bug in a shorter function.</p>
</div>
<div id="documenting-code" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Documenting code</h2>
<p>Having written the first unit test, we can create the actual function for it <strong>and</strong> its documentation using <code>roxygen2</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="co">#&#39; @title Adds 1 and 1</span>
<span class="co">#&#39;</span>
<span class="co">#&#39; @description This magnificent function computes the sum of 1 and 1.</span>
<span class="co">#&#39;</span>
<span class="co">#&#39; @export  </span>
<span class="co">#&#39;</span>
<span class="co">#&#39; @return  returns 2</span>
<span class="co">#&#39;  </span>
<span class="co">#&#39; @examples</span>
<span class="co">#&#39;   a &lt;- g()</span>
<span class="co">#&#39;   print(a)</span>
g &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>function() <span class="dv">1</span> +<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">1</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then build the documentation:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">devtools::<span class="kw">document</span>(<span class="st">&quot;./newpkg&quot;</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>An excellent help for creating documentation (of S3 and S4) is for instance <a href="https://github.com/variani/pckdev">pckdev</a> or the official <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html">vignette</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="checking-code" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Checking code</h2>
<p>If you want to submit your package to <code>CRAN</code> or <code>Bioconductor</code> certain criteria must be fulfilled. Some of which can be tested by checking or package like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">devtools::<span class="kw">check_cran</span>(<span class="st">&quot;./newpkg&quot;</span>)</code></pre></div>
<pre><code>Checking 1 CRAN packages =================================================</code></pre>

<pre><code>NULL</code></pre>
<p>This does not test for Bioconductor though. For this you have to install <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BiocCheck.html"> BioCheck</a> manually and call <code>R CMD BiocCheck newpkg*.tar</code> on the command line.</p>
</div>
<div id="static-code-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> Static code analysis</h2>
<p><code>lintr</code> checks your code for style, syntax error and possible issues. You can also incorporate <code>lintr</code> in your unit tests and let them fail, if lints are discovered.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">if (<span class="kw">requireNamespace</span>(<span class="st">&quot;lintr&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">quietly =</span> <span class="ot">TRUE</span>)) {

<p>What <code>lintr</code> considers worth reporting can be customized in a <code>.lintr</code> file in your package root directory.</p>
<p>Let’s see if our small package is lint free:</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.7</span> Running examples</h2>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Version control</h2>
<p>Aside from he fact that version control is great, putting your project on <code>GitHub</code> has the most prominent advantage that you can add badges to your <code>README.md</code> to show others about the state of your package, for instance repository, CI or code coverage status.</p>
<div align="center">

<p>Much of <code>R</code>’s popularity is due to its fantastic ecosystem. <code>R</code> users benefit heavily from CRAN and Bioconductor packages created by its community.</p>
<p>For data analysis or statistics <code>R</code> is a good choice for various reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>high-level,</li>
<li>easy to install packages,</li>
<li>can be extended to <code>C++</code> without needing knowledge of linking or <code>C++</code> build-systems,</li>
<li>probably the best plotting facility with <code>ggplot</code>, <code>cowplot</code>, <code>hrbrthemes</code> or <code>ggsci</code>,</li>
<li>Bioconductor, machine learning and statistics libraries,</li>
<li>small standard library.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few things, however, <code>R</code> is not so great at:</p>
<ul>
<li>in general slow,</li>
<li>not really suited for large projects,</li>
<li>poor object orientation,</li>
<li>inconsistent function names,</li>
<li>superior IDEs for Java, Python, …,</li>
<li>very limited threading capabilities.</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Extending to C++ using <code>Rcpp</code></h2>
<p>Using <code>Rcpp</code> (and <code>RcppEigen</code>, <code>RcppArmadillo</code>, <code>Boost</code>) you can easily your extend your code to C++. It not only nicely wraps the standard C API, but also let’s you use standard matrix libraries such as Eigen and Armadillo or Boost :heart_eyes:.</p>
<p>If you have a project that’s not a package you can for instance create a function like this:</p>

<p>Usually, you would want to put your source code into a <code>cpp</code> file in the <code>src</code> folder. Then you can call C++ from an R function, for instance as described below.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Define a C++ source file and put it in <code>src</code>, like this:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>#include <Rcpp.h>

// [[Rcpp::export]]
Rcpp::List dostuff()
{
  // some computations

  return Rcpp::List::create(
    Rcpp::Named("a") = ...
  );
}</code></pre>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Add this to your <code>DESCRIPTION</code>:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>Imports: Rcpp
LinkingTo: Rcpp</code></pre>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Add a comment <code>#' @useDynLib newpkg, .registration = TRUE</code> to the documentation of any function, better yet to the package doc.</p></li>
<li><p>Call <code>devtools::document()</code></p></li>
<li><p>Call <code>Rcpp::compileAttributes(&quot;./newpkg&quot;)</code></p></li>

<p>This should let you access the C++ function from your package.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> data.table</h2>
<p><code>data.table</code> is a fast implementation of R’s classical <code>data.frame</code>. I hardly ever use data frame any more, and if so only, because it seems to work nicer with <code>dplyr</code> and <code>tidyr</code>. However, using <code>dtplyr</code> this isn’t much of a problem, really.</p>

<p>In the end it depends what style you prefer. I usually go with <code>data.table</code> alone without needing the <code>dplyr/dtplyr</code> dependency. However, the latter is usually more readable. For large data, the fastest solution is probably preferrable.</p>

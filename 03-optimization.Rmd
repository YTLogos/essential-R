# Optimization

Much of statistical and machine learning boils down to function optimization (if you are not necessarily interested in Bayesian inefrence). In you don't want to implement an optimizer for yourself, the following couple of libraries might be of interest to you.

## Convex optimization

CVXR

## Non-linear optimizaton

minqa and nloptr,

## LP solve

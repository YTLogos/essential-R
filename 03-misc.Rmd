## Workflow management

I recently came across [`drake`](https://ropensci.github.io/drake/index.html) as a workflow manager. It allows you to run a project and easily update output files.

## Pry back the covers of R 

In some cases it is interesting to have a look at the implementation of specific functions, get their sizes in byte or get the current memory consumption. It is especially useful to keep track of the addresses your objects point to. When I was new to R I found it confusing when a reference is dropped and when a new copy of an object is created.

```{r}
library('pryr')
pryr::inspect(list())
pryr::inspect(vector())

pryr::object_size(numeric())
pryr::object_size(numeric(1))

x <- stats::rnorm(10)
y <- x
pryr::address(x)
pryr::address(y)
y[1] <- 1
pryr::address(y)
```
